# Darwin's Game
## Description
The idea is losely based on Conway's Game of Life, but the idea is that there are predators and prey. The last cells standing effectively win the game, hence "darwin." The cells don't evolve in any meaningful way but just consume and run. There's a fixed amount of bio mass in the game and that rule is upheld.
